        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a graduate student pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at George Mason University, with a strong foundation in Information Technology from my undergraduate studies. I have hands-on experience in software development, machine learning, and web technologies, and I enjoy building practical, real-world applications such as medical image analysis systems, Android apps, and IoT-based solutions. Currently, I work as a Teaching Assistant at George Mason, where I support instruction, grading, and student learning while strengthening my communication and leadership skills. I am passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and using technology to create meaningful impact in both academic and community-focused environments.
